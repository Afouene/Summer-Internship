# Detailed Riggable 3D Face Prediction

The project was tested on windows with python 3.6.13 ,PyTorch 1.10.2 , torchvision 0.11.3 .
### Changes I've done so far 
1. requirements.txt : I specified which versions worked for me the best that were compatible with that version of python as well the hole algorithms.
2. main.py : I had some computational problems so I've added some lines to get results
3. render.py : The pygame shows a black image so I've tried the solutions given in issues (none worked).
